# x86_game
A small game thrown together to help learn x86 assembly. Written using MASM and visual studio

Aim is to avoid the wall (the dashes "----") with you character (the #). Left and right arrow keys to move.

Also movement breaks a bit if you hold the keys down, and mashing the buttons too much is carple tunnel inducing  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
